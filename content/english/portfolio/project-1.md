##### Postdoctoral Fellowship MRI Pulse Sequence Design

My biophysical research interests have always skewed towards the submicroscopic / atomic scale. It is a surprise to many that the same techniques I used to probe the submicroscopic dynamics of proteins and DNA (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) as a graduate student are in fact the basis of macroscopic [MRI imaging](https://bit.ly/3bdg1Pa) used in hospitals and medical centers around the world. The grey and white "contrast" observed in MR-Images typically represent differences in the atomic scale motions water molecules undergo in different tissue types throughout the body.      

In most forms of MRI we are actually specifically focused on the hydrogen atoms in water molecules because they are so abundant in the human body and have a number of properties that make them especially easy to probe via magnetic resonance; namely they 1) readily interact with electromagnetic radiation like radio waves which easily pass through body tissues, 2) are relativley mobile / free to undergo rotational and translational motion in solution and 3) have a spin quantum number of $\frac{1}{2}$. Had you up to that last part huh? 

#### Primer on quantum spin
Quantum mechanical spin is an intrinsic property of atomic nuclei not unlinke more familiar properties to us like mass or charge. Getting into what exactly spin is and why it exisits is something of a rabit hole, like asking why mass exisits. We will side step it and simply accept the reality of the spin property of hydrogen nucli. The quantum spin state of a spin $\frac{1}{2}$ nucli can be completley described by two basis vectors we refer to as the $|\alpha>$ and $|\beta>$ states. 

In everyday life the existence of $|\alpha>$ and $|\beta>$ spin states in hydrogen nuclei might just be another oddity of the quantum world, but in the presence of an applied magnetic field $|\alpha>$ and $|\beta>$ spin states become every so slightly different; hydrogen atoms in the $|\alpha>$ spin state align with the direction of the applied magnetic field (like two magnets that are drawn together into a stable configuration) while hydrogens in the $|\beta>$ spin state align against the applied magnetic field placing them into a slightly higher / less stable energy configuration (like when the reupsilve ends of two magnets are held close together). Although random thermal fluctuations are constantly causing the two spin states of hydrogen to interconvert, because the $|\beta>$ state is less stable in the magnetic field a slight excess of $|\alpha>$ spin hydrogen is created.

By applying radio frequency radiation equal to the energy difference between $|\alpha>$ and $|\beta>$ spin state nucli we can either create quantum superpositions of $|\alpha>$ and $|\beta>$ spins or, alternatively, temporally invert the the spin states by placing the net excess of spins into the less stable $|\beta>$ configuration.
 
It is the population inversion mechanism that will be most relevant to the work I will present here.

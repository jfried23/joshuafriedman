It's Josh! I like to think of myself as a professional student, cheerleader / enabler for my team and goto problem solver for all things ill defined.<br><br>I began my career in academia where I was actve in fields that spaned focus from the motions individual atoms to science policy for national security.<br><br>But I have since transitioned to Data Science, applying many of the same computational techniques I used as a scientist to address a much more diverse set of unknowns, while learning more about all things statitistics and machine learning.

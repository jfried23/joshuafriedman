I am a data scientist, regular scientist, life long student, teamleader, and goto problem solver for all things ill defined. Deeply skeptical about all that has been done, but wildly optimistic about all that could be.<br><br>I began my career in as a biophysicsts where I was actve in reseach areas touching on computational protein design, magnetic resonance imagining, DNA damage repair and science policy for national security. [See a listing of my academic publications here.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=joshua+I+friedman&sort=date)<br><br>Now as a Data Scientist, I get to apply many of the same computational techniques I used as a researcher to address an even broader set of set of questions and continue persuing my intrests in all things methodology, computer science and machine learning related.

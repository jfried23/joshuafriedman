      content : "I developed a novel deep learning methodology for assigning likely demographic characteristics to individuals based upon media consumption patterns and known geographic demographics. This scalable solution reduced operational costs by a factor of 10 over legacy solutions (nearest neighbor matching) and is a core methodology for numerous measurement products today.

I am a data scientist, regular scientist, life long student, teamleader, and goto problem solver for ill defined objectives. I work to balance my own skepticism about all that has been done, but wildly optimistic about all that could be.<br><br>I began my career in as a biophysicists where I was active in research areas touching on computational protein design, magnetic resonance imagining, DNA damage repair and science policy for national security. [See a listing of my academic publications here.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=joshua+I+friedman&sort=date)<br><br>Now as a Data Scientist, I get to apply many of the same computational techniques I used as a researcher to address an even broader set of set of questions and continue pursuing my interests in all things methodology, computer science and machine learning related.
